Performance hit due to false sharing in parallel computing

This repository contains a C file which gives the computation time differences between two scenarios : parallel processing with false sharing and parallel processing without false sharing.

I have added comments to make the code self-explanatory.
For further explanation on false sharing Refer this blog : www.parallelcomputing2017.wordpress.com
